<h1>Organização do Código com div e span</h1>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
<div>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</div>
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
unchanged.
<span>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,</span> and
more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
